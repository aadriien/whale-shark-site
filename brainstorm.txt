KEY QUESTIONS

* How many whale sharks do we see over time?
*** How many sightings (occurrences) are reported per year? 
*** Of those sightings each year, which months are they happening in?
*** How many are male vs female vs unknown? 
*** How many are juveniles vs adults vs unknown?

* When & where are we most likely to see them?
*** How many sightings are reported in each country? Each continent?
*** Of those countries & continents, how many sightings in each calendar month? 

* How many have we seen before / can we "track" their journey over time?
*** How many organism IDs were reported more than once? 
*** For each individual, where (& when) did we see them? 
*** What else do we know about them? Sex? Life stage? Any media? 

* Where are the data coming from? 
*** How many reports does each publishing country have? Average per year? 
*** When did the reports happen? Is publishing consistent or intermittent? 
*** For each publishing country, where are they going for their research? 
*** Who's providing media? Who's doing so regularly?
*** What's the ratio of human observation to machine observation to other?

* What are the gaps in the data?
*** Of all the reports, how many specified sex? Life stage? Organism ID? Media? 




DATA STRUCTURING

* CSV of sightings per calendar year, with months as columns (log occurrences in time)

* CSV of continent stats (total occurrences, average per year, who are the publishing countries, how many have media)

* CSV of country stats (total occurrences, average per year, who are the publishing countries, how many have media)

* CSV of publishing country stats (total occurrences, average per year, what countries are they visiting, how many have media)

* CSV of stats by basisOfRecord (human observation vs machine observation, etc)

* CSV of individual whale sharks (based on organismID and/or identificationID), exploring number of times seen, calendar period (when), countries found in, etc

* CSV of stats by sex (where data available)

* CSV of stats by lifeStage (where data available)
