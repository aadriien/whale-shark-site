# üêã ü¶à Whale Shark Site x Computer Vision 

## Training Data Overview

This folder contains large datasets used for computer vision tasks.

Datasets from `training-data` and `extracted-data` are **NOT included** in the repository due to size limitations.


## Download Instructions

1. Download a [dataset](#linked-datasets) (`.tar`) 
2. Place `.tar` file in the `training-data` folder 
3. Set `tar_file` (name / path) in `extract_tar_data.py`
4. Run `.tar` extraction with:
    ```sh
    # Assuming at root of whale-shark-site
    make extract_tar
    ```
5. Navigate to the `extracted-data` folder for results

### Computer Vision Models

I used Ultralytics' [YOLOv8](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/yolov8) object detection model to home in on whale shark objects in a given image, for the purpose of generating BBOXes (bounding boxes) for MiewID-msv3 input.

I used Wildbook's [MiewID-msv3](https://huggingface.co/conservationxlabs/miewid-msv3) wildlife re-identification model to extract the image embeddings that help identify individual whale sharks.
