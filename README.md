# 🐋 🦈 Whale Shark Master Site

## Description

Take a deep dive into the world of gentle giants with this **master website of whale shark data**! 

For this project, `whale-shark-site`, I aim to bridge the gap between scientific research and everyday engagement by amassing shark, climate, and ocean data from a variety of sources—funneling them into one central site that can appeal to users of all backgrounds.

## Project Goals

While this platform is inherently educational, I want it to also be **accessible and exciting**. It should mirror the feeling you experience when you step inside a really interesting museum, or a particularly impressive library. This master site of whale shark data is a kind of playground. It's meant to be **discovered and explored**.

This is a **work in progress**, but I can assure you that I'm fit to burst with ideas and plans! A project of this nature is a huge undertaking, with many moving pieces, so please hang tight while I chip away. 🚀 

In the meantime, feel free to explore the codebase and/or reach out with any questions. 


## Technical Overview

### Data Sources

- **GBIF**: Biodiversity data (whale shark records)

- **NASA**: Climate and Earth data

- **Copernicus**: Ocean and marine data


### Tech Stack

- **Python**: APIs + data pipelines

- **Vite + React**: Web app

- **JavaScript + TypeScript**: Under the hood web utils 

- **Three.js (+ WebGL)**: 3D web graphics

- **P5.js + D3.js**: Interactive web + data visuals

- ...

- others on the way, stay tuned :-) 


## How It Works

### Data pipelines (ETL)

1. Data fetched from API endpoints

2. Data cleaned, prepped, aggragated, and analyzed

3. Data stored and summoned for web use


### Website (web app)

1. Pages dedicated to different audiences

    - **Science and research** (data + detail)

    - **Fun and play** (interaction + connection)

2. Insight from data pipelines pulled in to web pages

3. JavaScript libraries prettify content for user engagement


## Features

- **🌍 Realistic Earth models**: Three.js globes built for discovery, to explore the data.
- **🛰️ Satellite tracking by tag**: Mapping of where the sharks have been, and where they are going.

- **🦈 Individual shark views**: Personal detailing of various whale sharks worldwide.
- **🤿 Personal diver stories**: Records and takeaways from divers who have encountered them.
- **💻 Computer vision matching**: Integration of a really neat open source Hugging Face model.

- **📊 Historic data trends**: Holistic insights into the sharks (+ related factors) over time.
- **📸 Real media and clean visuals**: Pictures, videos, and plenty of thoughtful visualizations.


## Design Choices

- **Modular separation**: Careful isolation of data pipelines and web processes to keep things clear.

- **Reusable pieces**: Features that are built iteratively and with maximum flexibility for later reuse.

- **Functional scalability**: Efficient data storage and web organization for long-term expansion.

- **Playful education**: Plenty to learn, but with exploration and engagement as the primary goal.

### Libraries and Modules

Thank you to Sean Bradley, whose open source [JEasings module](https://github.com/Sean-Bradley/JEasings), a JavaScript animation engine, allows me to control movements on the Three.js globe for "storytelling mode".
