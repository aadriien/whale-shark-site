                <p>
                    Whale sharks are true global travelers of the warm seas, 
                    roaming the tropical and subtropical waters of the world's oceans, 
                    and leaving their peaceful mark beneath the waves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, across the Indian Ocean, 
                    to the coasts of Australia, Madagascar, and Mozambique — 
                    and even as far as Hawaii and the Galápagos Islands — 
                    these gentle giants traverse the open seas, 
                    frequently venturing closer to coastal areas, coral reefs, and sunlit waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Known for migrating thousands of miles each year, 
                    whale sharks follow seasonal plankton blooms and feeding hotspots.
