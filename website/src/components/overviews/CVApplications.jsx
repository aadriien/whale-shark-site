                <p>
                    These computer vision applications are revolutionizing how we study and protect whale sharks. 
                    By automating time-intensive analysis tasks, researchers can process vastly more data, 
                    leading to better understanding of whale shark ecology and more effective conservation strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The technology also enables real-time monitoring and rapid response to threats, 
                    making whale shark conservation more proactive and data-driven than ever before.
